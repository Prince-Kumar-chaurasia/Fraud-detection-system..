This comprehensive fraud detection system represents an end-to-end machine learning solution designed to identify fraudulent financial transactions in real-time with high accuracy and operational reliability. Beginning with raw transaction data containing 6.3 million records across 10 features, the system implements meticulous data preprocessing including handling missing values, detecting outliers, and addressing severe class imbalance where fraudulent transactions constitute only 0.13% of the dataset. Through sophisticated feature engineering, it creates domain-specific indicators such as balance change calculations, transaction type flags, amount-to-balance ratios, and temporal patterns that capture the behavioral signatures of fraudulent activities typically involving TRANSFER and CASH-OUT operations where accounts are systematically emptied
At its core, the system employs multiple machine learning models with XGBoost emerging as the optimal choice, achieving excellent ROC-AUC scores through careful hyperparameter tuning and class imbalance handling via SMOTE oversampling. The model demonstrates particular effectiveness in identifying patterns where transactions completely drain accounts or involve unusually large amounts relative to existing balances. For production deployment, a Flask-based REST API provides real-time scoring capabilities with comprehensive risk assessment, categorizing transactions into actionable risk levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) with corresponding recommendations (BLOCK, FLAG_AND_HOLD, FLAG_FOR_REVIEW, ALLOW). Each prediction includes explainable AI components that highlight the top contributing factors, enhancing investigator trust and regulatory compliance.
Complementing the prediction engine, an interactive Dash dashboard offers real-time monitoring with visualization of fraud trends, risk distributions, and alert management, while an automated retraining pipeline continuously evaluates model performance, detects concept drift, and schedules updates to maintain accuracy over time. The infrastructure is containerized with Docker for scalable deployment, includes comprehensive logging and monitoring through Prometheus/Grafana integration, and features both SQLite for lightweight operation and scalability options for enterprise database systems. Complete with automated deployment scripts, health checks, and security considerations, this system delivers a production-ready fraud detection framework that balances algorithmic sophistication with practical implementation requirements for financial institutions seeking to proactively combat transaction fraud.
